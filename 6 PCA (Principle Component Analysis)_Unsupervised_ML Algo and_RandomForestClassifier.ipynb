    "About Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a statistical technique to convert high dimensional data to low dimensional data by selecting the most important features that capture maximum information about the dataset. The features are selected on the basis of variance that they cause in the output. The feature that causes highest variance is the first principal component. \n",

    "Advantages of PCA\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "There are two main advantages of dimensionality reduction with PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "1> The training time of the algorithms reduces significantly with less number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2> It is not always possible to analyze data in high dimensions. For instance if there are 100 features in a dataset. Total number of scatter plots required to visualize the data would be (100(100-1))/2 = 4950. Practically it is not possible to analyze data this way."

    "Normalization of Features\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "It is imperative to mention that a feature set must be normalized before applying PCA. For instance if a feature set has data expressed in units of Kilograms, Light years, or Millions, the variance scale is huge in the training set. If PCA is applied on such a feature set, the resultant loadings for features with high variance will also be large. Hence, principal components will be biased towards features with high variance, leading to false results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last point to remember before we start coding is that PCA is a statistical technique and can only be applied to **numeric data. Therefore, categorical features are required to be converted into numerical features before PCA can be applied."
